# LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) Code examples

LDPC codes are a type of linear forward error correcting code.  They are high performance and in some cases approach the Shannon Limit.  A few protocols/standards that use LDPC:
  *  IEEE 802.3an (10GBASE-T)
  *  802.16E (Mobile WIMAX)
  *  DVB-C2 (Digital Video Broadcasting - Cable)
  *  G.hn (ITU-T Standard for networking over power lines)

This repository contains and example LDPC encoder and decoder implemented in Python.  The objective is to create a fast, easy to use LDPC encoder/decoder.

The LDPC codes used in this project are from the 802.16E standard/
